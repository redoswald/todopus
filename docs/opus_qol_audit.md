# Opus — Structured QoL Audit

## What We're Working With

**Current state (from screenshots + past conversations):**
- Sidebar with Zone 1 (Opus logo), Zone 2 (nav + project tree), Zone 3 (avatar + settings gear)
- Navigation: Inbox, Today (with count badge), Upcoming, Completed, Maestro
- Project hierarchy with sections, sub-projects, and emoji support (🎨 Making)
- Task creation inline from Inbox — title, description (markdown), project assignment, scheduled date, deadline, priority (color dots)
- Project pages with wiki-like purpose/description at top, sections, and task list below
- Maestro AI panel slides in from right — portfolio review, daily planning, overdue check
- Settings is a modal with just the Anthropic API key
- Shared Supabase auth with All Friends
- "Add task" in sidebar navigates to Inbox with inline creation form

## 2. DESTRUCTIVE ACTION SAFETY

| Feature | Status | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Delete confirmation for tasks | ❓ Partial | High | I see a trash icon on task hover (project view), but no confirmation modal visible |
| Delete confirmation for projects | ❓ Unknown | High | Deleting a project with 20 tasks should be scary — requires modal + typing project name |
| Undo after task delete | ❌ | High | Toast with "Undo" (5-second window). Critical for accidental clicks |
| Undo after task complete | ❌ | Medium | Checking off the wrong task should be reversible. Brief delay or undo toast |

---

## 3. EMPTY & EDGE STATES

|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Empty inbox | ❓ Unknown | High | What does a new user see? Should be "Nothing here — add your first task" with a friendly prompt |
| Empty Today | ❓ Unknown | Medium | "Nothing due today" is good — but could celebrate: "You're all caught up!" |
| Empty project (no tasks) | ❓ Unknown | Medium | New project created → show "Add your first task" affordance |
| Empty Completed view | ❓ Unknown | Low | "Nothing completed yet — get to work!" (playful) |

---

## Summary: Top 10 Priorities

1. ~~**⌘K command palette**~~ ✅ — Implemented with task/project search, view navigation, actions
2. **Toast/undo system** — Every create, complete, and delete needs feedback. Destructive actions need undo
3. **Delete confirmations** — Especially for projects with tasks. Task delete needs undo toast at minimum
4. ~~**Real settings page**~~ ✅ — Route-based /settings with Profile, Maestro AI, Security, Apps, Data cards
5. ~~**App switcher**~~ ✅ — AppSwitcher in sidebar Zone 1 + Apps card on settings page
6. **Empty states** — New user experience for Inbox, Today, projects
7. **Save indicators for descriptions** — Project wiki and task descriptions need auto-save feedback. Losing edits silently would be brutal
8. **Loading skeletons** — Task lists, project trees, Today view
9. **Quick-add from any view** — Creating a task shouldn't require navigating away from Today or a project view
10. **Mobile responsiveness** — Sidebar collapse, touch targets, responsive task creation

---

## Opus-Specific Design Notes

**The "Add task" flow needs rethinking.** Currently it navigates to Inbox to show the creation form. This means if you're looking at your "Making" project and think "oh, I should add a task here," you have to leave, go to Inbox, create the task, assign it to Making, then navigate back. Every view should have a "+ Add task" affordance that pre-fills the current context (current project, today's date if on Today view, etc.).

**Maestro's position is good but the panel should be smarter.** The right-side slide-in is the right pattern (VS Code, Notion AI, Copilot all do this). But Maestro should be context-aware — if you open it from a project page, it should scope to that project. If you open it from Today, it should focus on today's plan.

**The API key situation needs a longer-term plan.** Storing the user's Anthropic key in Supabase and calling the API from the browser works, but it means the key is exposed in network requests. A lightweight server-side proxy (Supabase Edge Function or Vercel serverless function) that holds the key server-side and proxies requests would be more secure. Not urgent, but worth noting for when other people start using this.

**The project tree will get unwieldy.** You already have 3 top-level groups (Personal Projects, Projects, Areas) with nested sub-items. Consider collapsible sections (which you may already have) and potentially a "starred" or "favorites" concept so your most-used projects are always visible without scrolling.
